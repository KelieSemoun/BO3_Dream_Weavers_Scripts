# Call of Duty: Black Ops III Custom zombies map : Spyro 1 Dream Weavers. Script Repository

This is a portfolio repository of the edited scripts I've provided when developing my custom zombies map Dream Weavers for NoahJ456's thrid mapping contest themed around video games. The time limit was 50 days and was a very enjoyable and insighful challenge !

Here are links of useful infos :

* [My Drive containing video showcase of some scripts shared in here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VoH1eAwojs38X9H_Sy3CJd9kyWczbvZb?usp=drive_link)

## How to use the repository

The repository has two folders : The Original Script made by other people and the edited scripts made by myself. On the Orginal folder, you will find the original script I got to work with when they shared these assests in public. And on the Edited folder, you will find the edit I brought to them plus some original scripts I've made.

Regarding the edited files, you can go to each file, press `Ctrl + F` and look for `-- Edited part by KelieSemoun` to read a short description of what I brought to the original file.

Thank you for your attention !
